# My-Mini-Map


**One Paragraph of project description goes here:
  
  This mini map will be a web based browser (mobile app coming soon) showing the location of the user, with what is in proximity to said user, such reataurants, grcoery stores, shopping stores, gas stations ect. We will be including a search feature so you can find anything that is nearby and display on a interactive map, navigational tools, weather and local time. This will all be saved in local storage allowing each user to be able to see what they have previously searched for.
